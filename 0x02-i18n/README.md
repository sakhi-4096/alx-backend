# i18n 
Internationalization (i18n) is the process of designing and developing software or products that can be adapted to different languages and cultures.

## Description
The purpose of i18n is to prepare software so that it can support local languages, cultural settings, and meet the requirements of local markets. It is an important step in the globalization effort, making it easier to localize a product for specific target audiences without losing its functionality. It involves neutralizing code, content, and design so that it can be easily adapted to additional cultures without having to completely redevelop the product.
>The term "i18n" is a shorthand for internationalization, where "18" is the number of letters between the first and last character.

## Features
* Designing and developing software or products that can be adapted to different languages and cultures.
* Neutralizing code, content, and design so that it can be easily adapted to additional cultures without having to completely redevelop the product.
* Removing predefined formatting instructions from the source code and putting that information in like how it's done for the application's text.
* Removing hard-coded references or links to specific graphic images and instead using placeholders, similar to how they're used for user interface.
* Making it easier to localize a product for specific target audiences without losing its functionality.
* Preparing software so that it can support local languages, cultural settings, and meet the requirements of local markets.
* Allowing a product to be easily converted to meet the userâ€™s cultural and personal requirements.
