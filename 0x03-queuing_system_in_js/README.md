# Queuing System in JS
A queuing system in JavaScript involves managing the flow of tasks or processes in a sequential manner, similar to how a queue operates in real life. 

## Description
 In JavaScript, you can create a queuing system using arrays or linked lists to store tasks or processes. Tasks are added to the end of the queue and processed sequentially based on their order of arrival. This system involves adding tasks to a queue and processing them based on their order of arrival, ensuring a structured and organized flow of operations within a program or application. 
> By leveraging data structures, asynchronous operations, and an understanding of JavaScript's event loop, you can effectively build and manage queuing systems in JavaScript for various applications and scenarios.

## Features
* **Task Management:** Tasks or processes are added to the queue and processed sequentially, ensuring that each task is executed in the order it was added.
* **Order Preservation:** The queuing system maintains the order of tasks, processing them based on their arrival time to uphold the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Queuing systems are commonly used to manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript, ensuring that tasks are executed one after the other without overlapping.
* **Data Structures:** Utilizes data structures like arrays or linked lists to store and manage tasks efficiently, allowing for easy addition and removal of tasks from the queue.
* **Event Loop Integration:** Queuing systems align with JavaScript's event loop mechanism, enabling the orderly execution of tasks by leveraging the event-driven nature of JavaScript.
* **Error Handling:** Effective queuing systems incorporate error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions and ensure smooth task execution without disrupting the overall flow.
