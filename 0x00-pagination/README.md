## Description
Pagination is a technique used in web development and software applications to divide a large set of data into smaller, manageable chunks or pages. It allows users to navigate through these pages to view a subset of data at a time rather than displaying the entire dataset on a single page. Pagination is commonly used in scenarios where presenting all data at once would be overwhelming, both for the user and for system performance.

## Features
* **Page Size:** The number of items or records displayed on each page is referred to as the "page size" or "items per page." Common page sizes might be 10, 20, 50, or any other number depending on the application's design.
* **Page Number:** Pagination involves breaking the dataset into pages, and each page is assigned a unique page number. Users can navigate through these pages using controls like next and previous buttons.
* **Navigation Controls:** Pagination typically includes controls, such as "Next," "Previous," and page number links, to allow users to move forward or backward through the pages.
* **Limiting Data Retrieval:** In the context of databases, pagination is often associated with limiting the number of records retrieved from the database at once. This is essential for performance reasons, especially when dealing with large datasets.
* **Reduced Load Time:** By presenting only a subset of data on each page, pagination helps reduce load times for web pages. Loading a smaller set of data is quicker than loading the entire dataset, improving user experience.
* **Scalability:** Pagination contributes to the scalability of web applications. Handling smaller chunks of data at a time allows the application to scale more efficiently as the dataset grows.
* **APIs and Services:** Pagination is also commonly used in APIs and services that return large amounts of data. The API response might include information about the current page, total number of pages, and the actual data for that page.
* **User Experience:** Pagination improves user experience by presenting data in a more organized and navigable manner. Users can focus on a specific subset of information without feeling overwhelmed by a large dataset
